<h1>Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript</h1>

Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

Pure Functions
It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects

The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:
Given a parameter A → expect the function to return value B
Given a parameter C → expect the function to return value D
A simple example would be a function to receive a collection of numbers and expect it to increment each element of this collection.

Immutability 
When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.
In Javascript we commonly use the for loop. This next for statement has some mutable variables.

Referential transparency 
pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency
