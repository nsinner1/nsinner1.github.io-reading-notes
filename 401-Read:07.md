<h1>Python Scope & the LEGB Rule: Resolving Names in Your Code</h1>

Functions: The Local Scope
The local scope or function scope is a Python scope created at function calls. Every time you call a function, you’re also creating a new local scope. On the other hand, you can think of each def statement and lambda expression as a blueprint for new local scopes. These local scopes will come into existence whenever you call the function at hand.

By default, parameters and names that you assign inside a function exist only within the function or local scope associated with the function call. When the function returns, the local scope is destroyed and the names are forgotten.

square() is a function that computes the square of a given number, base. When you call the function, Python creates a local scope containing the names base (an argument) and result (a local variable). After the first call to square(), base holds a value of 10 and result holds a value of 100. The second time, the local names will not remember the values that were stored in them the first time the function was called. Notice that base now holds the value 20 and result holds 400.

Notice that you define cube() using the same variable and parameter that you used in square(). However, since cube() can’t see the names inside the local scope of square() and vice versa, both functions work as expected without any name collision.

You can inspect the names and parameters of a function using .__code__, which is an attribute that holds information on the function’s internal code.


Nested Functions: The Enclosing Scope

Enclosing or nonlocal scope is observed when you nest functions inside other functions. It takes the form of the local scope of any enclosing function’s local scopes. Names that you define in the enclosing Python scope are commonly known as nonlocal names.

When you call outer_func(), you’re also creating a local scope. The local scope of outer_func() is, at the same time, the enclosing scope of inner_func(). From inside inner_func(), this scope is neither the global scope nor the local scope. It’s a special scope that lies in between those two scopes and is known as the enclosing scope.

When you call outer_func() the code runs down to the point in which you call inner_func(). The last statement of inner_func() tries to access another_var. At this point, another_var isn’t defined yet, so Python raises a NameError because it can’t find the name that you’re trying to use.


Modules: The Global Scope

From the moment you start a Python program, you’re in the global Python scope. Internally, Python turns your program’s main script into a module called __main__ to hold the main program’s execution. The namespace of this module is the main global scope of your program.

Whenever you run a Python program or an interactive session like in the above code, the interpreter executes the code in the module or script that serves as an entry point to your program. This module or script is loaded with the special name, __main__. From this point on, you can say that your main global scope is the scope of __main__.

To inspect the names within your main global scope, you can use dir(). If you call dir() without arguments, then you’ll get the list of names that live in your current global scope.

When you call dir() with no arguments, you get the list of names available in your main global Python scope. Note that if you assign a new name (like var here) at the top level of the module (which is __main__ here), then that name will be added to the list returned by dir().

There’s only one global Python scope per program execution. This scope remains in existence until the program terminates and all its names are forgotten. Otherwise, the next time you were to run the program, the names would remember their values from the previous run.

Inside func(), you can freely access or reference the value of var. This has no effect on your global name var, but it shows you that var can be freely accessed from within func(). On the other hand, you can’t assign global names inside functions unless you explicitly declare them as global names using a global statement.

Whenever you assign a value to a name in Python, one of two things can happen:
You create a new name
You update an existing name

The concrete behavior will depend on the Python scope in which you’re assigning the name. If you try to assign a value to a global name inside a function, then you’ll be creating that name in the function’s local scope, shadowing or overriding the global name. This means that you won’t be able to change most variables that have been defined outside the function from within the function.

Within increment(), you try to increment the global variable, var. Since var isn’t declared global inside increment(), Python creates a new local variable with the same name, var, inside the function. In the process, Python realizes that you’re trying to use the local var before its first assignment (var + 1), so it raises an UnboundLocalError.

Modifying global names is generally considered bad programming practice because it can lead to code that is:

Difficult to debug: Almost any statement in the program can change the value of a global name.
Hard to understand: You need to be aware of all the statements that access and modify global names.
Impossible to reuse: The code is dependent on global names that are specific to a concrete program.

Good programming practice recommends using local names rather than global names. Here are some tips:

Write self-contained functions that rely on local names rather than global ones.
Try to use unique objects names, no matter what scope you’re in.
Avoid global name modifications throughout your programs.
Avoid cross-module name modifications.
Use global names as constants that don’t change during your program’s execution.
