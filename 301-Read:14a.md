Introduction to Database Normalization
Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.  The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included. Take a spreadsheet containing the information as an example, where the data contains salespeople and customers serving several purposes:

Identify salespeople in your organization
List all customers your company calls upon to sell a product
Identify which salespeople call on specific customers.
By limiting a table to one purpose you reduce the number of duplicate data contained within your database. This eliminates some issues stemming from database modifications.

Reasons for Database Normalization
There are three main reasons to normalize a database.  The first is to minimize duplicate data, the second is to minimize or avoid data modification issues, and the third is to simplify queries. 

Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies
Notice that for each SalesPerson we have listed both the SalesOffice and OfficeNumber. There are duplicate salesperson data. Duplicated information presents two problems:

It increases storage and decrease performance.
It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes.
