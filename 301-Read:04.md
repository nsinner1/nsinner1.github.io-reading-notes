<h1>Regex tutorial — A quick cheatsheet by examples</h1>

Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are extremely useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern

One of the most interesting features is that once you’ve learned the syntax, you can actually use this tool in (almost) all programming languages

Use the . operator carefully since often class or negated character class (which we’ll cover next) are faster and more precise.
\d, \w and \s also present their negations with \D, \W and \S respectively.
For example, \D will perform the inverse match with respect to that obtained with \d.

In order to be taken literally, you must escape the characters ^.[$()|*+?{\with a backslash \ as they have special meaning.

<h1>A Complete Guide to Grid</h1>

CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system. You work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a parent element (which becomes the Grid Container) and to that element’s children (which become Grid Items).
