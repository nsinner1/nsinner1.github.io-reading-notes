<h1>Enriching Your Python Classes With Dunder (Magic, Special) Methods</h1>
https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods

What Are Dunder Methods?
In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example __init__ or __str__.

As it quickly became tiresome to say under-under-method-under-under Pythonistas adopted the term “dunder methods”, a short form of “double under.”

These “dunders” or “special methods” in Python are also sometimes called “magic methods.” 

Dunder methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types. For example, to get the length of a string you can call len('string'). But an empty class definition doesn’t support this behavior out of the box

Special Methods and the Python Data Model
This elegant design is known as the Python data model and lets developers tap into rich language features like sequences, iteration, operator overloading, attribute access, etc.

You can see Python’s data model as a powerful API you can interface with by implementing one or more dunder methods. If you want to write more Pythonic code, knowing how and when to use dunder methods is an important step.

Enriching a Simple Account Class
Throughout this article I will enrich a simple Python class with various dunder methods to unlock the following language features:

Initialization of new objects
Object representation
Enable iteration
Operator overloading (comparison)
Operator overloading (addition)
Method invocation
Context manager support (with statement)

Object Initialization: __init__
Right upon starting my class I already need a special method. To construct account objects from the Account class I need a constructor which in Python is the __init__ dunder
The constructor takes care of setting up the object. In this case it receives the owner name, an optional start amount and defines an internal transactions list to keep track of deposits and withdrawals.

Object Representation: __str__, __repr__
It’s common practice in Python to provide a string representation of your object for the consumer of your class (a bit like API documentation.) There are two ways to do this using dunder methods:

__repr__: The “official” string representation of an object. This is how you would make an object of the class. The goal of __repr__ is to be unambiguous.

__str__: The “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object. This is for the enduser.

Iteration: __len__, __getitem__, __reversed__
In order to iterate over our account object I need to add some transactions. So first, I’ll define a simple method to add transactions. I’ll keep it simple because this is just setup code to explain dunder methods, and not a production-ready accounting system

Operator Overloading for Comparing Accounts: __eq__, __lt__
This feels completely natural, but it’s actually quite amazing what happens behind the scenes here. Why does > work equally well on integers, strings and other objects (as long as they are the same type)? This polymorphic behavior is possible because these objects implement one or more comparison dunder methods.

Operator Overloading for Merging Accounts: __add__
In Python, everything is an object. We are completely fine adding two integers or two strings with the + (plus) operator, it behaves in expected ways

Callable Python Objects: __call__
You can make an object callable like a regular function by adding the __call__ dunder method. For our account class we could print a nice report of all the transactions that make up its balance

<h1>Tutorial: Basic Statistics in Python — Probability</h1>
https://www.dataquest.io/blog/basic-statistics-in-python-probability/

What is probability?
At the most basic level, probability seeks to answer the question, “What is the chance of an event happening?” An event is some outcome of interest. To calculate the chance of an event happening, we also need to consider all the other events that can occur. The quintessential representation of probability is the humble coin toss. In a coin toss the only events that can happen are:

Flipping a heads
Flipping a tails
These two events form the sample space, the set of all possible events that can happen. To calculate the probability of an event occurring, we count how many times are event of interest can occur (say flipping heads) and dividing it by the sample space. Thus, probability will tell us that an ideal coin will have a 1-in-2 chance of being heads or tails. By looking at the events that can occur, probability gives us a framework for making predictions about how often events will happen. However, even though it seems obvious, if we actually try to toss some coins, we’re likely to get an abnormally high or low counts of heads every once in a while. If we don’t want to make the assumption that the coin is fair, what can we do? We can gather data! We can use statistics to calculate probabilities based on observations from the real world and check how it compares to the ideal.
