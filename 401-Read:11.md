Data Science in a nutshell
<h1>https://headstrait.com/data-science-in-a-nutshell/</h1>

Data Science is basically trying to make sense of data by identifying patterns, applying algorithms to extract information and predict future actions that are suitable for a specific situation.

Unstructured Data: It does not have a predefined data model. It can be available in audio, video and text format.

Structured Data: It is mostly available in a text format which originates from databases or specific file formats like CSV (Comma Separated Values)

After categorizing data (unstructured or structured), you need to analyze it. Identifying patterns of the data and understanding the data by processing it in such a way that you convert the data into information. This area of processing the data is typically referred as Data Analytics.

Having analyzed this data, you’d want to present it visually so that decisions can be made. This is called Data Visualization.



<h1>JupyterLab</h1>

JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.

Code Consoles provide transient scratchpads for running code interactively, with full support for rich output. A code console can be linked to a notebook kernel as a computation log from the notebook, for example.
Kernel-backed documents enable code in any text file (Markdown, Python, R, LaTeX, etc.) to be run interactively in any Jupyter kernel.
Notebook cell outputs can be mirrored into their own tab, side by side with the notebook, enabling simple dashboards with interactive controls backed by a kernel.
Multiple views of documents with different editors or viewers enable live editing of documents reflected in other viewers. For example, it is easy to have live preview of Markdown, Delimiter-separated Values, or Vega/Vega-Lite documents.

NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package. By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem, like scikit-learn, that use NumPy under the hood.
