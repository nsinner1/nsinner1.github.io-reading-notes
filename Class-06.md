Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES
IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS

The terms elements and element nodes are used interchangeably but when people say the DOM is working with an element,
it is actually working with a node that represents that element.

DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist, which is a collection of nodes.

When a DOM method can return more than one element, it returns a Nodelist (even if it only finds one matching element).
