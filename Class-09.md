Chapter 7 Forms HTML

A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.

A form may have several form controls, each gathering different information. The server needs to know which piece of inputted data corresponds with which form element.

Form controls live inside a <form> element. This element should always carry the action attribute and will usually have a method and id attribute too.
Every <form> element requires an action attribute. Its value is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the information in the form when it is submitted.
The <input> element is used to create several different form controls. The value of the type attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating.
