Getting started
If you haven’t already done so, push your Next.js app to a Git provider of your choice: GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Your repository can be private or public.

Then, follow these steps:

Sign up to Vercel (no credit card is required).
After signing up, you’ll arrive on the “Import Project” page. Under “From Git Repository”, choose the Git provider you use and set up an integration. (Instructions: GitHub / GitLab / BitBucket).
Once that’s set up, click “Import Project From …” and import your Next.js app. It auto-detects that your app is using Next.js and sets up the build configuration for you. No need to change anything — everything should work just fine!
After importing, it’ll deploy your Next.js app and provide you with a deployment URL. Click “Visit” to see your app in production.
Congratulations! You’ve just deployed your Next.js app! If you have questions, take a look at the Vercel documentation.

If you’re using a custom server, we strongly recommend migrating away from it (for example, by using dynamic routing). If you cannot migrate, consider other hosting options.
