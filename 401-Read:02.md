<h1>Python Modules and Packages – An Introduction</h1>

Modular programming refers to the process of breaking a large, unwieldy programming task into separate, smaller, more manageable subtasks or modules. Individual modules can then be cobbled together like building blocks to create a larger application.

Simplicity: Rather than focusing on the entire problem at hand, a module typically focuses on one relatively small portion of the problem. If you’re working on a single module, you’ll have a smaller problem domain to wrap your head around. This makes development easier and less error-prone.

Maintainability: Modules are typically designed so that they enforce logical boundaries between different problem domains. If modules are written in a way that minimizes interdependency, there is decreased likelihood that modifications to a single module will have an impact on other parts of the program. (You may even be able to make changes to a module without having any knowledge of the application outside that module.) This makes it more viable for a team of many programmers to work collaboratively on a large application.

Reusability: Functionality defined in a single module can be easily reused (through an appropriately defined interface) by other parts of the application. This eliminates the need to duplicate code.

Scoping: Modules typically define a separate namespace, which helps avoid collisions between identifiers in different areas of a program. 


The Module Search Path

When the interpreter executes the above import statement, it searches for mod.py in a list of directories assembled from the following sources:

The directory from which the input script was run or the current directory if the interpreter is being run interactively
The list of directories contained in the PYTHONPATH environment variable, if it is set. (The format for PYTHONPATH is OS-dependent but should mimic the PATH environment variable.)
An installation-dependent list of directories configured at the time Python is installed

The import Statement

Module contents are made available to the caller with the import statement. The import statement takes many different forms, shown below.
import <module_name>

The pytest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

<h1>Recursion</h1>
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion/

What is Recursion?
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.

What is base condition in recursion?
In the recursive program, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems.

What is the difference between direct and indirect recursion?
A function fun is called direct recursive if it calls the same function fun. A function fun is called indirect recursive if it calls another function say fun_new and fun_new calls fun directly or indirectly. Difference between direct and indirect recursion has been illustrated in Table 1.
