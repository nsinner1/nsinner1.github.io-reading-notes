<h2>HTML Chapter 4</h2>
Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.
The text between the opening <a> tag and closing </a> tag is known as link text.
Links are created using the <a> element which has an attribute called href. The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to when they click on the link.
Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.
To create a link that starts up
the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the <a> element. 
If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening <a> tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.
