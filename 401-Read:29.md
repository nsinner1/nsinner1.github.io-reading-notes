<h1>Django Custom User Model</h1>
https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-custom-user-model

Django ships with a built-in User model for authentication, however the official Django documentation highly recommends using a custom user model for new projects. The reason is if you want to make any changes to the User model down the road--for example adding a date of birth field--using a custom user model from the beginning makes this quite easy. But if you do not, updating the default User model in an existing Django project is very, very challenging.

So always use a custom user model for all new Django projects. However the official documentation example is not actually what many Django experts recommend using. There is a far easier yet still powerful approach to starting off new Django projects with a custom user model which I'll demonstrate here.

To start, create a new Django project from the command line. We need to do several things:

create and navigate into a dedicated directory called users for our code
install Django
make a new Django project called config
make a new app users
start the local web server

Note that we did not run migrate to configure our database. It's important to wait until after we've created our new custom user model before doing so.

AbstractUser vs AbstractBaseUser
There are two modern ways to create a custom user model in Django: AbstractUser and AbstractBaseUser. In both cases we can subclass them to extend existing functionality however AbstractBaseUser requires much, much more work.

Custom User Model
Creating our initial custom user model requires four steps:

update settings.py
create a new CustomUser model
create new UserCreation and UserChangeForm
update the admin
In settings.py we'll add the users app and use the AUTH_USER_MODEL config to tell Django to use our new custom user model in place of the built-in User model. We'll call our custom user model CustomUser.

Within INSTALLED_APPS add users.apps.UsersConfig at the bottom. Then at the bottom of the entire file, add the AUTH_USER_MODEL config.
