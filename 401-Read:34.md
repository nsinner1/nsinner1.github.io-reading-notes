<h1>Configuring Django Settings: Best Practices</h1>
https://djangostars.com/blog/configuring-django-settings-best-practices/

Different environments. Usually, you have several environments: local, dev, ci, qa, staging, production, etc. Each environment can have its own specific settings (for example: DEBUG = True, more verbose logging, additional apps, some mocked data, etc). You need an approach that allows you to keep all these Django setting configurations.

Sensitive data. You have SECRET_KEY in each Django project. On top of this there can be DB passwords and tokens for third-party APIs like Amazon or Twitter. This data cannot be stored in VCS.

Sharing settings between team members. You need a general approach to eliminate human error when working with the settings. For example, a developer may add a third-party app or some API integration and fail to add specific settings. On large (or even mid-size) projects, this can cause real issues.

Django settings are a Python code. This is a curse and a blessing at the same time. It gives you a lot of flexibility, but can also be a problem – instead of key-value pairs, settings.py can have a very tricky logic.

settings_local.py
Pros:
Secrets not in VCS.
Cons:
settings_local.py is not in VCS, so you can lose some of your Django environment settings.
The Django settings file is a Python code, so settings_local.py can have some non-obvious logic.
You need to have settings_local.example (in VCS) to share the default configurations for developers.

Pros:
All environments are in VCS.
It’s easy to share settings between developers.
Cons:
You need to find a way to handle secret passwords and tokens.
“Inheritance” of settings can be hard to trace and maintain.


<h1>How Does SSH Work</h1>

What is SSH
SSH, or Secure Shell, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify their remote servers over the Internet. The service was created as a secure replacement for the unencrypted Telnet and uses cryptographic techniques to ensure that all communication to and from the remote server happens in an encrypted manner. It provides a mechanism for authenticating a remote user, transferring inputs from the client to the host, and relaying the output back to the client.

The Figure Below shows a typical SSH Window. Any Linux or macOS user can SSH into their remote server directly from the terminal window. Windows users can take advantage of SSH clients like Putty.  You can execute shell commands in the same manner as you would if you were physically operating the remote computer.

Symmetric Encryption
Symmetric encryption is a form of encryption where a secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of a message by both the client and the host. Effectively, any one possessing the key can decrypt the message being transferred.

Asymmetric Encryption
Unlike symmetrical encryption, asymmetrical encryption uses two separate keys for encryption and decryption. These two keys are known as the public key and the private key. Together, both these keys form a public-private key pair.

Hashing
One-way hashing is another form of cryptography used in Secure Shell Connections. One-way-hash functions differ from the above two forms of encryption in the sense that they are never meant to be decrypted. They generate a unique value of a fixed length for each input that shows no clear trend which can exploited. This makes them practically impossible to reverse.
