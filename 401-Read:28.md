<h1>Django Tutorial Part 9: Working with forms</h1>
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Forms

Overview
An HTML Form is a group of one or more fields/widgets on a web page, which can be used to collect information from users for submission to a server. Forms are a flexible mechanism for collecting user input because there are suitable widgets for entering many different types of data, including text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, date pickers and so on. Forms are also a relatively secure way of sharing data with the server, as they allow us to send data in POST requests with cross-site request forgery protection.

While we haven't created any forms in this tutorial so far, we've already encountered them in the Django Admin site â€” for example, the screenshot below shows a form for editing one of our Book models, comprised of a number of selection lists and text editors.

Working with forms can be complicated! Developers need to write HTML for the form, validate and properly sanitize entered data on the server (and possibly also in the browser), repost the form with error messages to inform users of any invalid fields, handle the data when it has successfully been submitted, and finally respond to the user in some way to indicate success. Django Forms take a lot of the work out of all these steps, by providing a framework that lets you define forms and their fields programmatically, and then use these objects to both generate the form HTML code and handle much of the validation and user interaction.

In this tutorial, we're going to show you a few of the ways you can create and work with forms, and in particular, how the generic editing views can significantly reduce the amount of work you need to do to create forms to manipulate your models. Along the way, we'll extend our LocalLibrary application by adding a form to allow librarians to renew library books, and we'll create pages to create, edit and delete books and authors (reproducing a basic version of the form shown above for editing books).

HTML Forms

The submit input will be displayed as a button (by default) that can be pressed by the user to upload the data in all the other input elements in the form to the server (in this case, just the team_name). The form attributes define the HTTP method used to send the data and the destination of the data on the server (action):

action: The resource/URL where data is to be sent for processing when the form is submitted. If this is not set (or set to an empty string), then the form will be submitted back to the current page URL.
method: The HTTP method used to send the data: post or get.
The POST method should always be used if the data is going to result in a change to the server's database because this can be made more resistant to cross-site forgery request attacks.
The GET method should only be used for forms that don't change user data (e.g. a search form). It is recommended for when you want to be able to bookmark or share the URL.

Django form handling process

Display the default form the first time it is requested by the user.
The form may contain blank fields (e.g. if you're creating a new record), or it may be pre-populated with initial values (e.g. if you are changing a record, or have useful default initial values).
The form is referred to as unbound at this point, because it isn't associated with any user-entered data (though it may have initial values).
Receive data from a submit request and bind it to the form.
Binding data to the form means that the user-entered data and any errors are available when we need to redisplay the form.
Clean and validate the data.
Cleaning the data performs sanitization of the input (e.g. removing invalid characters that might be used to send malicious content to the server) and converts them into consistent Python types.
Validation checks that the values are appropriate for the field (e.g. are in the right date range, aren't too short or too long, etc.)
If any data is invalid, re-display the form, this time with any user populated values and error messages for the problem fields.
If all data is valid, perform required actions (e.g. save the data, send an email, return the result of a search, upload a file, etc.)
Once all actions are complete, redirect the user to another page.

required: If True, the field may not be left blank or given a None value. Fields are required by default, so you would set required=False to allow blank values in the form.
label: The label to use when rendering the field in HTML. If a label is not specified, Django will create one from the field name by capitalizing the first letter and replacing underscores with spaces (e.g. Renewal date).
label_suffix: By default, a colon is displayed after the label (e.g. Renewal date:). This argument allows you to specify a different suffix containing other character(s).
initial: The initial value for the field when the form is displayed.
widget: The display widget to use.
help_text (as seen in the example above): Additional text that can be displayed in forms to explain how to use the field.
error_messages: A list of error messages for the field. You can override these with your own messages if needed.
validators: A list of functions that will be called on the field when it is validated.
localize: Enables the localization of form data input (see link for more information).
disabled: The field is displayed but its value cannot be edited if this is True. The default is False.

Other ways of using form template variable
Using {{ form.as_table }} as shown above, each field is rendered as a table row. You can also render each field as a list item (using {{ form.as_ul }} ) or as a paragraph (using {{ form.as_p }}).

It is also possible to have complete control over the rendering of each part of the form, by indexing its properties using dot notation. So, for example, we can access a number of separate items for our renewal_date field:

{{ form.renewal_date }}: The whole field.
{{ form.renewal_date.errors }}: The list of errors.
{{ form.renewal_date.id_for_label }}: The id of the label.
{{ form.renewal_date.help_text }}: The field help text.
