Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website, which can save a huge amount of time and effort.

Important notes about web scraping:
Read through the websiteâ€™s Terms and Conditions to understand how you can legally use the data. Most sites prohibit you from using the data for commercial purposes.
Make sure you are not downloading data at too rapid a rate because this may break the website. You may potentially be blocked from the site as well.

The first thing that we need to do is to figure out where we can locate the links to the files we want to download inside the multiple levels of HTML tags. Simply put, there is a lot of code on a website page and we want to find the relevant pieces of code that contains our data. If you are not familiar with HTML tags, refer to W3Schools Tutorials. It is important to understand the basics of HTML in order to successfully web scrape.

Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. Web scraping software may access the World Wide Web directly using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or through a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.
