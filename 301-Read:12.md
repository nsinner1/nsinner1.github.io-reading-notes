<h1>EJS Partials</h1>

Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views. Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you donâ€™t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in. Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file andinclude it wherever you need it.

In EJS, any JavaScript or non-HTML syntax you include in your templates is always surrounded by <% %> delimiters (you could change these delimiters if you really wanted to).
Including a partial in EJS is quite straightforward. You use <%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %> where the partial file is relative to the template you use it in.
