The Random module contains some very useful functions.

Randint
If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5. The first value should be less than the second.

Random
If you want a larger number, you can multiply it.

Choice
Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.
The choice function can often be used for choosing a random element from a list.

Shuffle
The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.

Randrange
Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)



<h1>What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?</h1>
https://www.edureka.co/blog/risk-analysis-in-software-testing/

In Software Testing, risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done. The categorization of the risks takes place, hence, the impact of the risk is calculated.

Why use Risk Analysis?
After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.

High: means the effect of the risk would be very high and non-tolerable. The company might face loss.

Medium: it is tolerable but not desirable. The company may suffer financially but there is a limited risk.

Low: it is tolerable. There lies little or no external exposure or no financial loss.

The perspective of Risk Assessment
Effect – To assess risk by Effect. In case you identify a condition, event or action and try to determine its impact.

Cause – To assess risk by Cause is opposite of by Effect. Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind that.

Likelihood – To assess risk by Likelihood is to say that there is a probability that a requirement won’t be satisfied.

How to perform Risk Analysis?
There are three steps:

Searching the risk

Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

Measures for the risk identified
