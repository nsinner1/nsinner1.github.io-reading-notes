Chapter 5

To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attribute:
    src: This tells the browser where it can find the image file.
    alt: This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.
    title: You can also use the title attribute with the <img> element to provide additional information about the image

Chapter 12

The font-family property allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element(s) to which a CSS rule applies.

You can specify different values for the first letter or first line of text inside an element using :first-letter and :first-line.
