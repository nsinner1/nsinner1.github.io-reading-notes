EASILY CREATE STUNNING ANIMATED CHARTS WITH CHART.JS

How to set up/create aminated charts https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2013/11/easily-create-stunning-animated-charts-with-chart-js/

<h1>Basic usage of canvas</h1>

At first sight a <canvas> looks like the <img> element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the <canvas> element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties.
Providing fallback content is very straightforward: just insert the alternate content inside the <canvas> element. Browsers that don't support <canvas> will ignore the container and render the fallback content inside it. Browsers that do support <canvas> will ignore the content inside the container, and just render the canvas normally.
he <canvas> element requires the closing tag (</canvas>). If this tag is not present, the rest of the document would be considered the fallback content and wouldn't be displayed.

<h1>Drawing shapes with canvas</h1>

There are three functions that draw rectangles on the canvas:

fillRect(x, y, width, height)
Draws a filled rectangle.
strokeRect(x, y, width, height)
Draws a rectangular outline.
clearRect(x, y, width, height)
Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.
Each of these three functions takes the same parameters. x and y specify the position on the canvas (relative to the origin) of the top-left corner of the rectangle. width and height provide the rectangle's size.

To make shapes using paths, we take some extra steps:

First, you create the path.
Then you use drawing commands to draw into the path.
Once the path has been created, you can stroke or fill the path to render it.
Here are the functions used to perform these steps:

beginPath()
Creates a new path. Once created, future drawing commands are directed into the path and used to build the path up.
Path methods
Methods to set different paths for objects.
closePath()
Adds a straight line to the path, going to the start of the current sub-path.
stroke()
Draws the shape by stroking its outline.
fill()
Draws a solid shape by filling the path's content area.

<h1>Applying styles and colors</h1>

Up until now we have only seen methods of the drawing context. If we want to apply colors to a shape, there are two important properties we can use: fillStyle and strokeStyle.

fillStyle = color
Sets the style used when filling shapes.
strokeStyle = color
Sets the style for shapes' outlines.
color is a string representing a CSS <color>, a gradient object, or a pattern object. We'll look at gradient and pattern objects later. By default, the stroke and fill color are set to black (CSS color value #000000).

There are several properties which allow us to style lines.

lineWidth = value
Sets the width of lines drawn in the future.
lineCap = type
Sets the appearance of the ends of lines.
lineJoin = type
Sets the appearance of the "corners" where lines meet.
miterLimit = value
Establishes a limit on the miter when two lines join at a sharp angle, to let you control how thick the junction becomes.
getLineDash()
Returns the current line dash pattern array containing an even number of non-negative numbers.
setLineDash(segments)
Sets the current line dash pattern.
lineDashOffset = value
Specifies where to start a dash array on a line.

<h1>Drawing text</h1>

The canvas rendering context provides two methods to render text:

fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
Fills a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
Strokes a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.

There are some more properties which let you adjust the way the text gets displayed on the canvas:

font = value
The current text style being used when drawing text. This string uses the same syntax as the CSS font property. The default font is 10px sans-serif.
textAlign = value
Text alignment setting. Possible values: start, end, left, right or center. The default value is start.
textBaseline = value
Baseline alignment setting. Possible values: top, hanging, middle, alphabetic, ideographic, bottom. The default value is alphabetic.
direction = value
Directionality. Possible values: ltr, rtl, inherit. The default value is inherit.
These properties might be familiar to you, if you have worked with CSS before.

The following diagram from the WHATWG demonstrates the various baselines supported by the textBaseline property.
