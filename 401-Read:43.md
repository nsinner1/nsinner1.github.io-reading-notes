<h1>Enriching Your Python Classes With Dunder (Magic, Special) Methods</h1>
https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods

What Are Dunder Methods?
In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example __init__ or __str__.

As it quickly became tiresome to say under-under-method-under-under Pythonistas adopted the term “dunder methods”, a short form of “double under.”

These “dunders” or “special methods” in Python are also sometimes called “magic methods.” But using this terminology can make them seem more complicated than they really are—at the end of the day there’s nothing “magical” about them. You should treat these methods like a normal language feature.

Dunder methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types.

Enriching a Simple Account Class
Throughout this article I will enrich a simple Python class with various dunder methods to unlock the following language features:

Initialization of new objects
Object representation
Enable iteration
Operator overloading (comparison)
Operator overloading (addition)
Method invocation
Context manager support (with statement)
You can find the final code example here. I’ve also put together a Jupyter notebook so you can more easily play with the examples.

Object Initialization: __init__
Right upon starting my class I already need a special method. To construct account objects from the Account class I need a constructor which in Python is the __init__ dunder:

Object Representation: __str__, __repr__
It’s common practice in Python to provide a string representation of your object for the consumer of your class (a bit like API documentation.) There are two ways to do this using dunder methods:

__repr__: The “official” string representation of an object. This is how you would make an object of the class. The goal of __repr__ is to be unambiguous.

__str__: The “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object. This is for the enduser.

Iteration: __len__, __getitem__, __reversed__
In order to iterate over our account object I need to add some transactions. So first, I’ll define a simple method to add transactions. I’ll keep it simple because this is just setup code to explain dunder methods, and not a production-ready accounting system:

Operator Overloading for Comparing Accounts: __eq__, __lt__
We all write dozens of statements daily to compare Python objects:

This feels completely natural, but it’s actually quite amazing what happens behind the scenes here. Why does > work equally well on integers, strings and other objects (as long as they are the same type)? This polymorphic behavior is possible because these objects implement one or more comparison dunder methods.

Operator Overloading for Merging Accounts: __add__
In Python, everything is an object. We are completely fine adding two integers or two strings with the + (plus) operator, it behaves in expected ways:

Again, we see polymorphism at play: Did you notice how + behaves different depending the type of the object? For integers it sums, for strings it concatenates. Again doing a quick dir() on the object reveals the corresponding “dunder” interface into the data model:

Python Iterators That Iterate Forever
We’ll begin by writing a class that demonstrates the bare-bones iterator protocol in Python. The example I’m using here might look different from the examples you’ve seen in other iterator tutorials, but bear with me. I think doing it this way gives you a more applicable understanding of how iterators work in Python.

Over the next few paragraphs we’re going to implement a class called Repeater that can be iterated over with a for-in loop, like so:


<h1>What Are Python Generators?</h1>
https://dbader.org/blog/python-generators

Generators are a tricky subject in Python. With this tutorial you’ll make the leap from class-based iterators to using generator functions and the “yield” statement in no time.

Python Generators 101 – The Basics
Let’s start by looking again at the Repeater example that I previously used to introduce the idea of iterators. It implemented a class-based iterator cycling through an infinite sequence of values.

Python Generators That Stop Generating
In this tutorial we started out by writing an infinite generator once again. By now you’re probably wondering how to write a generator that stops producing values after a while, instead of going on and on forever.

Remember, in our class-based iterator we were able to signal the end of iteration by manually raising a StopIteration exception. Because generators are fully compatible with class-based iterators, that’s still what happens behind the scenes.

Thankfully, as programmers we get to work with a nicer interface this time around. Generators stop generating values as soon as control flow returns from the generator function by any means other than a yield statement. This means you no longer have to worry about raising StopIteration at all!
